# About

Engineer and curious learner, currently bringing intelligent automation to the enterprise back-office as co-founder of [CoPlane](https://coplane.com). Before starting CoPlane, I built financial systems at Stripe and worked on large-scale data infrastructure at Google (BigQuery Storage, Kaggle).

Originally from Brazil, I grew up in Toronto, studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and now call the US home.

### Things I'm Exploring:

* **AI-first automation**: Transforming enterprise operations through data-centric, intelligent automation.
* **LLM-mediated development**: Enhancing developer productivity with smarter tools.
* **Open Source and Economic Models**: Investigating how open source can sustainably solve collective-action problems (the tragedy of the commons).
* **Health optimization & mobility**: Fascinated by all things health including Kelly Starrett and KneesOverToesGuy mobility techniques, BPC-157, natural hormone optimization and injury recovery tools.

### Technical Areas of Interest:

* **Wasm in Serverless Computing**: Practical applications of WebAssembly in serverless environments (Cloudflare Workers, etc.).
* **Data Infrastructure Evolution**: Bridging the gap between data lakes and warehouses, and the tools emerging to solve these challenges.
* **Modern Databases and Ecosystems**: Exploring innovative databases and services like Supabase, Materialize, and Cloudflare's object store.
* **Durable Execution Patterns**: Building resilient, fault-tolerant execution models.
