# About

I'm an engineer at Google (Kaggle), and previously worked on BigQuery Storage. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

Things I'm currently thinking about and working on:

* Open source and its application to the tragedy of the commons
* Tools for thought
* The future of monetization for creators
* Rabbit hole of [AthleanX](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A) videos.
* Making my way through [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/).
