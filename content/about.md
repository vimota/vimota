# About

I'm a Brazilian-Canadian engineer joining Stripe's Financial Data team in October, having previously worked at Google (BigQuery Storage, Kaggle). I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

Things I'm currently thinking about and working on:

* Open source and its application to the tragedy of the commons
* Tools for thought
* The future of monetization for creators
* Rabbit hole of [Kelly Starrett mobility videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnB4zDBqZHhQ4uLTAX8eYA).
* Making my way through [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/).
