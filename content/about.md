I'm an engineer at Google (Kaggle), and studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

Things I'm currently thinking about and working on:

* Radical Markets (Reading)
* Rabbit hole of [AthleanX](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A) videos.
* Exploring the Nocode/zerocode maker movement.
* Habit building.
* Making my way through [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/).
