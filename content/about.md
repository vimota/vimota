# About

I was born in Brazil and grew up in Toronto but currently live in the US. I'm an engineer and co-founded [CoPlane](https://coplane.com) to bring AI to the back office of large enterprises. Before that I was part of Stripe's Financial Systems team, having previously worked at Google (BigQuery Storage, Kaggle). I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
\
\
Things I'm working on or loosely thinking about:

- Data-centric and AI-first Automation for Enterprises
- LLM-based developer tools
- Open source and its application to the tragedy of the commons
- Rabbit hole of [Kelly Starrett mobility videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnB4zDBqZHhQ4uLTAX8eYA), BPC-157 and injury recovery tools.

\
Technical areas I'm investigating:

- Wasm's use case in serverless (Workers, etc)
- The space between a datalake and Data Warehouse, the tools for the gap
- Better dbs and services for them (ie. Supabase, Materialize, Cloudflare object store, etc)
- Durable Execution
